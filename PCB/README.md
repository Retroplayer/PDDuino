Complete BOM, including Feather 32u4 Adalogger board, 105mah lipo battery, and pin header sockets: <https://www.digikey.com/short/zr44wt><br>

You may remove the following items from the cart:<br>
* Battery - If you use the BCR port or other usb power source, then you don't need the battery.<br>
* Socket headers - If you want to solder the Adalogger board using the pins it comes with, then you don't need the sockets.<br>
* Adalogger board - If you already have one, you don't necessarily need more.

The same PDDuino_Feather adapter board works for both the 32u4 and the M0 versions of Adalogger boards.
